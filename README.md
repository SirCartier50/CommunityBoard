## Notes

I had an issue with display the images which was because I wasn't importing static images so I imported them and added some css to give them a fixed height and width that fit inside the cards. Also had an issue with overlapping text because it was too long and fixed it by adding word-wrap and overflow-wrap to the css for h5 and gh6.
